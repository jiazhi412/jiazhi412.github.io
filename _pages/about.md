Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Jiazhi Li.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and a Graduate Research Assistant at Information Sciences Institute, both being units of USC Viterbi School of Engineering, under supervision of Prof. Wael AbdAlmageed. My research interests include computer vision, face recognition, and fair representation learning.
